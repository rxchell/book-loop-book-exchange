## What is ***Book Loop***?

***Book Loop*** is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Book Exchange Platform. It is designed to create a seamless and community-driven solution for book enthusiasts to share and exchange physical books.

> The name ***Book Loop*** reflects the idea of circulating books among readers, emphasizing the sharing and community aspects of the platform.


## Origin
The idea stems from the realization that many books are often left unread on shelves, while others may be searching for the very same books. This platform aims to give books a second life, encouraging sustainability by reducing waste and fostering a community of readers.
